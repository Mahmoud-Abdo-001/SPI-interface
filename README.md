# SPI-interface
This repository contains the RTL implementation of a simple SPI Masterâ€“Slave interface, featuring a 10-bit write and 8-bit read protocol. The design is verified using multiple methodologies, including SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), UVM-based testbench, and Python-based Cocotb testing.
